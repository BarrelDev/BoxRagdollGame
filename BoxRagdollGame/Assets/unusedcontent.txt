Hey there!

If you're a dataminer or some kinda person looking for unused files this is for you.
Although this isn't exactly great for me, I hope you find something interesting in here!
I do request that you don't outright copy my game and pass it around illegally but I have no control over that.

Well I'll at least keep some cool facts about any unused content I leave behind.
